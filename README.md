# web3-portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects and skills, with a focus on Web3 development. The frontend is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, while the smart contract interactions will be handled by a Moccasin project using Vyper.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **`next-app/`**: Contains the Next.js frontend application. This is where the UI, components, and client-side logic reside. See the [next-app/README.md](next-app/README.md) for more details on the frontend.
- **`moccasin/`**: The house the Moccasin project for smart contract development using Vyper. This will handle the backend logic and blockchain interactions.
